### working on the data we retrived from the website

```{r}
#read data
raw_train_data <- read.csv(file = "train.csv")
raw_oil <- read.csv(file = "oil.csv")
```

### select store with number 11, 19, 27, 35, 46 
```{r}
raw_test_0 <- raw_train_data[raw_train_data$store_nbr == 11 
                      | raw_train_data$store_nbr == 19
                      | raw_train_data$store_nbr == 27
                      | raw_train_data$store_nbr == 35
                      | raw_train_data$store_nbr == 46,]

# store num can be changed here


raw_test_1 <-  raw_test_0[raw_test_0$family == 'DELI'
                        | raw_test_0$family == 'GROCERY I'
                        | raw_test_0$family == 'MEATS',]

# 3 families are select here: DELI, GROCERY I, MEATS




```



```{r}
# problem, some days have sale but no oil price, might take last available oil price to fill NA?
raw_merge_oil <- merge(raw_test_1, raw_oil, by = "date", 
                  all.x = TRUE) 

raw_merge_oil$date <- as.POSIXct(raw_merge_oil$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")


raw_merge_oil_dropna <-filter(raw_merge_oil, sales > 0)
# 75 obs is dropped here due to zero sales

raw_merge_oil_dropna <- raw_merge_oil_dropna[
  order( raw_merge_oil_dropna[,1], raw_merge_oil_dropna[,3] ),
]
# reordering


raw_merge_oil_dropna <- subset(raw_merge_oil_dropna, select = -c(id) )

colnames(raw_merge_oil_dropna)[6] ="oil_price"

```


```{r}
raw_merge_oil_dropna$date <- as.Date(raw_merge_oil_dropna$date)
raw_merge_oil_dropna$store_nbr <- as.factor(raw_merge_oil_dropna$store_nbr)
raw_merge_oil_dropna$family <- as.factor(raw_merge_oil_dropna$family)
raw_merge_oil_dropna$sales <- as.double(raw_merge_oil_dropna$sales)
raw_merge_oil_dropna$onpromotion <- as.integer(raw_merge_oil_dropna$onpromotion)
raw_merge_oil_dropna$oil_price <- as.double(raw_merge_oil_dropna$oil_price)

class(raw_merge_oil_dropna$store_nbr)
#change store_nbr to factor
```


### trying to deal with empty oil price
```{r}
test <- raw_merge_oil_dropna %>% fill(oil_price)
# Fill empty oil price with value of last non-empty oil price

```



```{r}
write.csv(test, "store_sales_cleaned_combined.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```


```{r}

```


```{r}

```
